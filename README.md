Google Data Analytics certified, I love analysing data by using tools including Excel, SQL, Power Bi and Tableau to provide insights and outcome from raw information in order to drive decisions. Strategic thinking, strong communication, organizational and analytical skills. 
I am trying to improve my skills every day and I will be happy to work on any project shared by anyone.
I am also looking for a job opportunity as data analyst; it could be a contract, freelance or permanent job; I am completely opened.
- Thanks everyone for any support
